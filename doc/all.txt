SAFARI NEWS
About Lions :
Can a lion look directly at you?
Yes, lions can look directly at you, and eye contact can affect how we behave. Here's some information about lions and eye contact:
Lion body language
If a lion is less than 50 yards away, has its ears laid back, and is staring at you, it could be preparing to attack.
Lion vision
Lions have forward-facing eyes and are designed for hunting. They have better nocturnal vision than humans, and can see 6 to 8 times better in low light.
Lion encounters
If you encounter a lion, you should stand your ground, slowly retreat, and face the lion. You can also make yourself look bigger by clapping, shouting, and waving your arms. You should never run or turn your back.
Lion relationships with humans
Lions rescued as cubs can form a bond with their rescuer, and may see them as a surrogate parent or family.
Lion hunting
Lions don't usually hunt humans, but they are most threatened by humans who hunt them or take over their habitat.
